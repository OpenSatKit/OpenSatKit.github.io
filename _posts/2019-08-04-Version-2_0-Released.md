<p>This release does not contain a lot of new functionality however the main screen's tabs and flow of the tool has dramatically changed which is why it's a major release. It's a beta release because I haven't finished all of the documentation and tutorials but I didn't want to hold up the release. OSK was originally intended as a cFS training tool. However, it missed this goal. It provided a lot of functionality and features but it failed to introduce the cFS in a manner that explained how to use the cFS for a mission. There's also a growing need for an application development kit and a cFS deployment kit. These realizations are based on some great feedback that is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Release notes for Beta Version 2.0:</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Created a reference Simple Sat (SimSat) spacecraft to provide context for how the cFS can meet a mission's objectives.</li>
  <li> Changed the 'tab flow' to (1)Explore cFS/SimSat, (2)Manage Apps, and (3)Extend OSK.</li>
  <li> As part of the flow change documentation, demos, and tutorials are launched in context-specific screens.</li>
  <li> Added a 'hello world' sample app template that matches the 'QQ' app example in the cFE App Developers Guide. This is much more complete than the 'sample app'.</li>
</ul>

<p>OSK roadmap...</p>
<ul>
  <li> Continue to improve the documentation: Complete User's Guide. Improve self-guided training modules with exercises.</li>
  <li> Complete CFDP testing and use as the primary file transfer protocol.</li>
  <li> Enhance the Manage App tab to include browsing and adding apps from a library and creating an app plugin model.</li>
  <li> Integrate cFE 6.6 and start to improve the unit test infrastructure. cFE 6.6 still has some known unit test deficiencies.</li>
</ul>
