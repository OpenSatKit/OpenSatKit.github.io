<p>Aitech and Embedded Flight Systems (EFSI) have announced a partnership to integrate NASA’s cFS (core Flight System) into Aitech’s modular SP0-S space CompactPCI (cPCI) SBC. The effort makes use of Aitech’s SBC and optimized SP0-S drivers along with EFSI’s Linux distribution. Together, those enable the real-time performance required in space-based systems by providing real-time processor performance, low process-dispatch latencies, minimal process run-time jitter and complete partition independence, says Aitech.</p>
